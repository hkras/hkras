Multiple censorship boards could mean multiple cuts of the same film. Self-censorship seemed the better way to go.<br><br>In 1927, Hays suggested that studio executives form a film censorship committee. Fox’s Sol Wurtzel, Metro Goldwyn Mayer’s Irving G. Thalberg, and Paramount’s E. H. Allen collaborated on a list they called the \“Don’ts and Be Carefuls,\” also referred to as the \“Magna Carta.\” This list was based on items that had previously been challenged by local censorship boards. It listed 11 subjects to be avoided and 26 to be handled very carefully.<br><br>The Federal Trade Commission approved the list and Hays created the Studio Relations Committee to oversee its implementation. But, there was still no way for the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) to enforce it."
